# Pylae Smoke Checklist (manual)

- **Login**: Sign in as admin and as user; verify quick code login where allowed.
- **Gate logging**: Log entry/exit with valid/invalid member numbers; ensure badge warnings show and visits list updates; edit visit notes.
- **Members**: Create/update member, assign office/type, add/clear photo; export members (xlsx/json) and generate badge PDF.
- **Sync**: Use Remote Sites dialog to fetch info, pull visits range, pull/push master (merge and overwrite paths), confirm status log updates and audit entries.
- **Backup/Restore**: Create backup with photos; restore package and confirm restart prompt; ensure data present after restart.
- **Users**: Add/edit/deactivate/delete users (admin-only), reset password/quickcode; self-service change password/quickcode on settings tab.
- **Audit/Visits exports**: Export visits/audit in xlsx/json; verify files open.
- **Idle lock**: Idle timeout or Windows lock shows unlock dialog; switch-user path works.
